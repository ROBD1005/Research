SC_MPA_BoundaryInformation_LookupTable.csv,"Lookup table containing a list of South Coast (SC) Marine Protected Area (MPA) boundary coordinates. The boundary coordinates in this table were provided by Paulo Serpa, California Department of Fish and Wildlife."MPA_name,The name of the California Marine Protected Area described by the associated boundary coordinates. Name of the MPA as identified by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).MPA_designation,"Defines the type of MPA referenced in the MPA_name field. (SMCA = State Marine Conservation Area. An MPA designation that may allow some recreational and/or commercial take of marine resources (restrictions vary). SMCA (No-Take) = State Marine Conservation Area (No-Take). An MPA designation that generally prohibits the take of living, geological, and cultural marine resources, but allows potentially affected and ongoing permitted activities such as dredging and maintenance to continue. SMR = State Marine Reserve. An MPA designation that prohibits damage or take of all marine resources (living, geologic, or cultural) including recreational and commercial take. SMRMA = State Marine Recreational Management Area. A California Marine Management Act designation that limits recreational and commercial take of marine resources while allowing for legal waterfowl hunting to occur; provides subtidal protection equivalent to an MPA (restrictions vary). Special Closure - An area designated by the Fish and Game Commission that prohibits access or restricts boating activities in waters adjacent to sea bird rookeries or marine mammal haul-out sites (restrictions vary)."MPA_study_region,Defines the region of the MPA referenced in the MPA_name field.
