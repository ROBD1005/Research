Researchers will analytically explore the baseline characterizations for potential indicators of the state of the rocky intertidal ecosystems using newly collected data along with historical and contextual data from the region, evaluate the suitability of proposed draft metrics and other metrics for long term monitoring and assess initial changes in size and abundance of targeted species across newly created MPAs, existing MPAs and reference areas."SC_SBeach,Baseline Characterization of Sandy Beach Ecosystems,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Sandy beaches and adjacent surf zones provide important habitat for a variety of birds, wildlife and fish that feed on intertidal and subtidal invertebrates. Beaches are also widely used for recreational activities including shore-based fishing, clamming and bait collection, beachcombing, dog-walking, jogging, sunbathing, surfing, swimming, volleyball and other sports, birding, and picnicking. Important linkages between sandy beaches and other nearshore ecosystems are being identified and measured by the project team. For example, the amount of wrack and plankton delivered to beaches is dynamically linked to adjacent ecosystem features and ocean conditions. The condition of beach ecosystems is also linked to the reproductive success of beach-nesting fishes and birds.. Through measuring and monitoring these links on sandy beaches we can observe the direct and indirect effects of MPAs.This project will produce a comprehensive baseline characterization of sandy beach ecosystems in the South Coast region. This information will be used to understand important linkages between sandy beach and other nearshore ecosystems. A number of MPAs and reference sites are being surveyed by the project team. In addition, researchers are developing indicators of ecosystem conditions that will increase our understanding how sandy beaches can provide insight into the condition and functioning of MPAs in the South Coast MPA network. The project team is also testing protocols for long-term monitoring involving citizen-scientists and collaborations with established volunteer groups in the region."SC_Kelp_Rock,Baseline Characterization of Kelp and Shallow-Rock Ecosystems,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"The goal of this project is to characterize kelp and shallow rock ecosystems inside and outside MPAs in the South Coast region.The baseline surveys, together with historical and future data, will enable scientists to measure changes in species and communities over both short and long time scales. For two years, beginning in 2011, SCUBA divers will survey kelp forests and associated reference sites to estimate fish, kelp and benthic invertebrate densities, fish size distributions and percent cover of invertebrates and algae to produce a quantitative baseline characterization of the structure of kelp and shallow rock ecosystems in the South Coast. Kelp and shallow rock ecosystems inside the MPAs will be compared with associated reference areas outside MPAs. Surveys will be conducted using methods developed by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and the Cooperative Research and Assessment of Nearshore Ecosystems (CRANE) program, which will allow integration of historical, long-term datasets into this characterization. As part of this project, researchers will work to develop easily interpretable ecosystem indicators for assessing the state of kelp forests and make recommendations for future monitoring."SC_CitSci_Kelp,Citizen-Science SCUBA Surveys of Kelp Forests,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Through the Reef Check California Program, citizen scientists and Reef Check staff will conduct SCUBA_based surveys of the South Coast MPAs and reference sites to provide a quantitative assessment of rocky reefs and kelp forests. Divers will estimate density, population size, diversity, trophic structure, and biological habitat availability for key fish, invertebrate and algae species. Researchers will also draw on Reef Check Californiaês existing dataset to provide historical context to ongoing data collection. Data collected as part of this project will be used to make recommendations for long-term monitoring. Importantly, this project will build capacity for cost-effective long-term monitoring through a community network of citizen scientists."SC_Seabird,"Seabird use of Estuarine, Intertidal, and Subtidal Habitats",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,"MPAs can benefit seabird populations both directly and indirectly. Direct benefits include reduced disturbance to breeding and roosting sites and decreased human interaction (e.g., bycatch, light attraction, gear entanglement) at feeding sites. Indirect benefits include reduced competition with humans for food resources and greater prey supplies resulting from increased prey production. The overarching goal of this study is to determine how seabirds are using coastal habitats inside and outside of newly established MPAs within the South Coast region. The results of this study will provide a baseline to aid in future adaptive management of south coast MPAs. The study will determine if newly established MPAs provide adequate protection to seabird populations and, if not, where efforts can be made to provide additional protection. Pelagic Cormorants, Brandtês Cormorants, Western Gulls, Black Oystercatchers, Pigeon Guillemots, California Least Terns, and California Brown Pelicans are focal species of the study. They have been selected for their dependence on nearshore habitats and their susceptibility to human disturbances. Monitoring efforts will focus on seabird use of nearshore habitats for breeding, roosting, and foraging. The study will examine foraging in estuarine and nearshore habitats, use of rocky coastlines for roosting, breeding population size and productivity, and disturbance at breeding and roosting sites."SC_Aerial,Nearshore Substrate Mapping Using Multi-Spectral Imagery,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,"The goal of this project is to create high-resolution maps for shallow subtidal and intertidal benthic habitats in the South Coast region. These maps will depict features such as surfgrass meadows, kelp canopy, algal-covered rock and bare rock habitats. Substrate classification will be validated with field data provided by collaborating research teams as well as new sampling specifically for this project."SC_ROV,Baseline ROV Surveys of Subtidal Ecosystems,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Researchers leading this project will use a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to _flyÓ half a meter above the seafloor at depths ranging from 20 _ 500 meters. The ROV will take video and still images that will be used to characterize these deep-sea communities. Researchers will identify, count and size fishes and invertebrates in both soft-bottom and rocky habitats. The data collected as part of this project will provide a baseline characterization of selected MPAs and reference sites, an assessment of initial changes following MPA implementation and recommendations for future monitoring efforts in the region."SC_SocEco,Baseline Surveys of Human Activities,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The goal of the Monitoring Fisheries Uses and Values project is to better understand the influence and socioeconomic impact of marine protected areas (MPAs) on commercial fishing and charter fishing (CPFV) activities along California's South Coast. The objectives of this research are to: Collect detailed data on the 1) demographic characteristics; b) spatial use patterns; and c) economic profile for key commercial fisheries and the CPFV fleet of the South Coast; Utilizing previous baseline data collected by Ecotrust, conduct an assessment of spatial and socioeconomic changes in key commercial and CPFV fisheries since MPA implementation; Provide contextual information on the direct and indirect effects of MPA establishment and other driving factors attributing to economic change (e.g., general economic decline, closure of fisheries, additional spatial fishing regulations, loss of port infrastructure, etc) within the commercial and CPFV fisheries in the South Coast."SC_Integrative,Integrative Assessment of Baseline Conditions,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"The goals of this project are to provide a coordinated approach to monitoring across ecosystem features, so that data can be easily shared and analyzed in a unified framework, to ensure a standards-based approach to data and metadata management across projects, to facilitate data analysis and synthesis through dedicated workshops and working groups, and to produce an integrated dataset and series of data-based products (papers, presentations, outreach materials) providing a baseline characterization of ecological and socioeconomic conditions of the entire south coast region across ecosystem features as well as an assessment of initial changes in these conditions within the initial period of baseline monitoring."SC_Lobster,Baseline Characterization of California Spiny Lobsters,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,"The overarching goal this project is to form a partnership between scientists, stakeholders, managers, and volunteers to generate information on baseline levels of abundance, size distribution, behavior, and consumptive use of one of Californiaês most valuable fishery species, the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus). Researchers will quantify lobster density inside and outside MPAs in San Diego and Orange Counties, and link lobster density and distribution to habitat features. A key component of this project is a collaboration with members of the California Lobster Trap Fishermenês Association to implement a tag-recapture program to generate estimates of lobster abundance at large spatial scales as well as size distribution and rates of movement across MPA boundaries (spillover). Researchers will focus on quantifying and characterizing lobster movement behavior , on using lobster catch records from stakeholders and the Department of Fish and Game to determine landings and catch per unit effort (CPUE), and document short-term changes in fishing effort and efficiency due to MPA establishment."
