SC_Rocky_It,1,CBS_standard,"Biodiversity surveys were completed as described in the survey protocols, with the full number of transects surveyed for all methods"
SC_Rocky_It,2,CBS_reduced,"Biodiversity surveys were completed as described in the survey protocols, with a reduced number of transects surveyed for one or more methods"
SC_Rocky_It,3,CBS_first_point_layering,"Biodiversity point contact surveys were modified. Only the first point was recorded at each location, but all layering and epi/host relationships on that point were also recorded. The full number of transects were surveyed for all methods"
SC_Rocky_It,4,CBS_first_point_no_layering,"Biodiversity point contact surveys were modified. Only the first point was recorded at each location, and layering and epi/host relationships were not recorded. If layering occured, the top species was the organism recorded at this point, unless otherwise desired for a specific project. For example, if mussels are specifically of interest, layers over mussels may be ignored and mussels will be recorded at that point. In this case, the modification will be detailed in the project report and site notes. If epi/host relationships occur, the host species (the species attached to the substrate) was the organism recorded at this point. The full number of transects were surveyed for all methods."

SC_Rocky_It,7,CBS_reference,No biological data were collected (only GPS or other reference data were collected).
SC_Rocky_It,8,CBS_other,"Biodiversity surveys were completed, but site setup was greatly modified from the survey protocols."
SC_Rocky_It,9,CBS_partial_protocol,"No Biodiversity point contact surveys were done at this site, but one of the other biological survey methods was done (quadrats and/or swaths). In some cases, site setup may be different than a typical site."
